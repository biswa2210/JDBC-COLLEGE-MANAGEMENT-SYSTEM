## Use :point_down:

<div align="justified">
     
User has to run the project after opening it in eclipse or idea intellij. Then he has to see the menu. Accordingly he can choose options for specific tasks like adding records, deleting, searching or view records. These types of tasks can be done easily. Wrong credentials will note be taken. If same type of record for some specific cases is given then the program will not work for that. After using user can exit the program. From SQL environment also database can be accessed. This program is made with just real world idea. It is simple and efficient.
</div>

## Application and Discussion :point_down:

<div align="justified">
     
The "College Management System" has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardships faced by this existing system. Moreover, this system is designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner. The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data. It also provides error message while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge is needed for the user to use this system. Thus by this all it proves it is user-friendly.
College Management System, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather to concentrate on the record keeping. Thus, it will help organization in better utilization of resources.
Every organization, whether big or small, has challenges to overcome and managing the information of Student, College, Employee, Salary, Faculty. Every College Management System has different College needs, therefore we design exclusive employee management systems that are adapted to your managerial requirements.
This is designed to assist in strategic planning, and will help you ensure that your organization is equipped with the right level of information and details for your future goals. Also, for those busy executive who are always on the go, our systems come with remote access features, which will allow you to manage your workforce anytime, at all times. These systems will ultimately allow you to better manage resources.

## Future Scopes :point_down:

In a nutshell, it can be summarized that the future scope of the project circles
around maintaining information regarding:
• We can add printer in future.
We can give more advance software for College Management System including
more facilities
• We will host the platform on online servers to make it accessible worldwide
Integrate multiple load balancers to distribute the loads of the system
• Create the master and slave database structure to reduce the overload of the
database queries
• Implement the backup mechanism for taking backup of codebase and database
on regular basis on different servers
The above mentioned points are the enhancements which can be done to increase the applicability and usage of this project. Here we can maintain the records of College and Student. Also, as it can be seen that now-a-days the players are versatile, i.e. so there is a scope for introducing a method to maintain the College Management System.
Enhancements can be done to maintain all the College, Student, Fees, Employee, Faculty. We have left all the options open so that if there is any other future requirement in the system by the user for the enhancement of the system then it is possible to implement them. In the last we would like to thanks all the persons involved in the development of the system directly or indirectly. We hope that the project will serve its purpose for which it is develop there by underlining success of process.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
Requirement analysis is a software engineering technique that is composed of the various tasks that determine the needs or conditions that are to be met for a new or altered product, taking into consideration the possible conflicting requirements of the various users.
Functional requirements are those requirements that are used to illustrate the internal working nature of the system, the description of the system, and explanation of each subsystem. It consists of what task the system should perform the process involved, which data should the system holds and the interfaces with the user. The functional requirement identified are:
a.	Adding Student Record:
All the required student records detail along with specified duration of classes attended  along with specified faculty name and unique enrolment number.
b.	Displaying Whole Record:
All the added records are stored in a database and being displayed whenever the function is being called along with the time and date of issue.
c.	Searching Particular Student Information:
By entering a particular unique id of the student all the information of the particular student is being displayed. If no such record is found the particular message displaying no such student exist is displayed.
d.	Deleting Records:
Once a student has successfully returned the rented car the record could be easily deleted and the successive change in the database is being automatically handled.
e.	Updating Phone Number:
A request for changing student’s phone number could be easily handled by entering the unique id of the student and entering the new phone number which then gets updated in the database.
f.	Automatic update:
 to database once reservation is made or new student registered, the system updates the database without any additional efforts of the admin.

JDBC Connectivity:
We have successfully established a connection with the relation database model and created a new database called “college_management” using mysql . With the specified root route and in the specified location (here localhost ) with particular username and password we have established a smooth connection with our java project. Handling records and searching for them becomes easier which such database management system.
 We used a table “students”,”students_attendence”,”staffs”,”staffs_attendence” in our database and created number of  array  in order to check if multiple records of same student or staff  is being entered the entry is being declined stating that the above student staff  already exists. Various such check-in’s had been added to avoid duplication of data entry of redundancy. Such error handling easy searching and safer security of storing data is only being established with the help of this JDBC connectivity.
A JAR is a package file format was included in order to provide the connectivity of our database , typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources into one file for distribution. JAR files are archive files that include a Java-specific manifest file. They are built on the ZIP format and typically have a .jar file extension.
